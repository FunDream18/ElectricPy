SEL acrtac Submodule
====================


General Module Information
--------------------------

This module (rather a submodule of `rtac`) is intended to be utilized
as an Application Programming Interface (API) to work in conjunction
with AcSELerator RTAC software. The module grants programmatic access
to the Command Line Interface Tool, and provides additional
functionality to aid users in developing practical and useful scripts.


Public Functions
----------------

The public functions in the `acrtac` sub-module are available outside
of the AcRTAC class specifically because they are not dependent upon
the class attributes or methods.
